    "Data (pl.) represent the traces of the real-world processes, and exactly which traces we gather are decided by our data collection or sampling method.\n",
    "\n",
    "We as scientists take interest in processes. An important step in our work is separating a process form our data collection method. After separating the process from the data collection, we can see clearly that there are two sources of randomness and uncertainty. In particular, these are the uncertainty and randomness of the process itself, and the uncertainty of our collection methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part of the implication of this is that you can't just go around collecting data then immediately understand the processes of the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to begin gaining this understanding you need to simplify those captured traces into something more comprehensible, to something that somehow captures it all in a much more concise way, and that something could be mathematical models or functions of the data, known as statistical estimators.\n",

    "More precisely, statistical inference is the discipline that concerns itself with the development of procedures, methods, and theorems that al‚Äê low us to extract meaning and information from data that has been generated by stochastic (random) processes.\n",
