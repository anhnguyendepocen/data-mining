    " - Work through the problem conceptually to find the difficulties.\n",
    " - List out possible solutions. It's rare that your first solution is the optimal solution.\n",
    "3. When you feel you may have a correct solution, even if you aren't totally sure, transition to writing code by saying or asking, \"I think this particular solution is good, should I start coding with that?\"\n",
    " - This makes sure you're communicating with your interviewer, and you also make sure that you're headed int he right direction.\n",
    "4. Work your way through your code, which is itself a recursive process. At the end, run through your code line by line on a few examples to check it and make sure it is correct. Then give a timespace analysis."
